### This year...

I've let this website run on its own for several years now, and it's clear I post maybe once a year, if that.
Well, this is that once-a-year post.
Rather than focusing on a single event, this post reflects the tapestry of moments that made up my 2024.
It's strange how quickly the year seems to have slipped away, a blur of experiences that came and went in the blink of an eye.

The major highlights were:

1. I completed my PhD (yay?!)
2. I worked at a startup in LA, which led to a visit to a billionaire's house.
3. I wrapped up an internship at Sony AI in Tokyo.

I wonâ€™t dive deep into these pointsâ€”feel free to reach out if you're curious about them, and I'll be happy to share.
This post is more about the moments of growth throughout the year.
The insights that emerged in the moments between the moments - the quiet in the shower or the orange of a sunset.

That said, I'll scatter images that have highlighted this year throughout this post, so it's kind of a post with two very messy storylines - a pretty accurate representation of what goes on in my head.

### On building deeper connections

One of the biggest lessons Iâ€™ve learned this year is the importance of building meaningful connections from the start.
Many of us, myself included, often strive to project confidence and groundedness.
We want to build trust, make ourselves approachable, and generally cultivate a calm, centered presence.

But while the end goal is clear, Iâ€™ve often found the path to get there unclear.

Over the course of 2024, I had the privilege of interacting with a range of incredible peopleâ€”some with massive influence (hello, billionaires), others with exceptional talent, and many who, like me, are still figuring things out.
These conversations stirred up all sorts of feelings, as conversations with people often do.
Even though everyone I met was kind, some left a deeper impression than others.

The conversations that stayed with me the most were those with people who were intellectually drivenâ€”those who were knowledgeable, understood themselves well, and could clearly separate facts from personal opinions.

##### The Blank Slate

Writing this now, it feels a bit strange.
These were the conversations I never thought I should strive for.
Perhaps itâ€™s because of how I was raised or the way I naturally approached conversations, but I always assumed that kind words led to the best exchanges.
Kind words, in my mind, meant being the one asking the questions, listening, and letting the other person speak.

I call this the "Blank Slate Approach" - an approach where I enter a conversation with no preconceptions, listening intently and asking questions to understand the other personâ€™s perspective.
While this approach often works well, Iâ€™ve realized that itâ€™s most effective when the other person has something they need to unload.
Without that, and unless the person is thoughtful enough to return the favor, these conversations can feel one-sided, leaving me with little in return.
The worst case scenario happens when two similar people approach the conversation this way, leading to nothing but shallow "The weather's great today"s.

Iâ€™m not sure if this Blank Slate Approach is quite the same as active listening, but Iâ€™ve found that it doesnâ€™t always lead to the deeper connections I expected.

##### The Plate of Daggers

Some people say that to attract interesting people, you have to be interesting yourself.
While Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™m particularly interesting, I like to think Iâ€™m a bit more engaging than the average person (feel free to tell me if Iâ€™m wrong).
Over the years, Iâ€™ve had some truly magical experiences, and my hobbies are so niche that theyâ€™re hard to share with others.
I also hold a PhD in one of the hottest topics of 2024, have flown more miles in the past year than most people my age, and pseudo-picked up a new language by living in another country.
But hereâ€™s the thing: How does being interesting actually attract interesting people?
And more importantly, how does it lead to deep connections?

What does it take to build a meaningful connection with someone who shares your level of experience?
It seems like the more unique your experiences, the harder it is to find someone who relates.
The essence of deep connections, after all, is shared understanding through shared experiences.
And shared experiences rarely happen when they are interesting.

Some might say that being interesting and being strongly opinionated are different, and no one likes a strongly opinionated person.
However, I see them as two sides of the same coin.
Our experiences shape our opinions, and those opinions lead us to new experiences.
I struggle to understand how someone can travel the world, gain so much experience, and still say, "Iâ€™m not sure" when asked, "Passion or job security?" - a question that tends to divide people.
The thing is that "I'm not sure, what do you think?" tends to spark deeper communication - the goal we aspire to go.

Thereâ€™s an opposing viewpoint that we shouldnâ€™t worry about building deeper connections with people who donâ€™t share our views.
But personally, I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s the best approach.
Building deep connections is about understanding the perspectives of others, which in turn deepens our own understanding of the world.

I call this the "Plate of Daggers" approach.
Itâ€™s like showing up to a party holding a plate of daggers - at first, people are intrigued, wondering who brings a plate of daggers to a party.
The initial impression is exciting, but soon enough, the plate is set aside, forgotten because no one wants to get hurt.
The more "daggers" (strong opinions) a person brings to the table, the fewer people stick around at the end of the night.

This has been my experience when I approach conversations in this way.
Itâ€™s akin to the old saying, "Donâ€™t be interesting, be interested."
But isnâ€™t that just the Blank Slate Approach?

#### Layers of a Nebula

I think it surprises absolutely no one that the key to building deeper connections lies in balancing being interesting and being interested.
And, just as unsurprisingly, the ideal ratio of interest to interesting depends entirely on the person youâ€™re engaging with - their emotional baggage, the mood theyâ€™re in that day, and perhaps even the alignment of the cosmos.

A close friend once told me she aspires to be like moldable clay.
The idea is to approach life with a raw shape: having opinions and values, but staying open to being reshaped by new perspectives and experiences.
Itâ€™s an admirable philosophy, but I think it risks veering too close to being a pushover, depending on how much reshaping you allow.
Some opinions, after all, are foundational - more like virtues than viewpoints - and they arenâ€™t meant to be changed.
And said friend is far from a pushover, being careful about what is shaped and what is concrete, so maybe I'm just interpreting things wrongly.

Mayhaps, we should approach interactions like the layers of a nebula.
On the surface, we show our most vibrant, diverse "colors"; these are the passions and ideas that make us unique.
But as the conversation deepens, we peel back those outer layers to reveal the more solid hues at our core; our unchanging values, the things we truly stand for.
Itâ€™s less about overwhelming the other person with everything we have to offer and more about inviting them to explore, showing that thereâ€™s depth worth uncovering.

This approach strikes a balance: enough intrigue to spark interest, but with plenty left to discover.
Itâ€™s a way to keep things dynamic while staying authentic - a method that doesnâ€™t feel like you're overloading someone or diluting your own identity.

I know, I know.
This probably sounds suspiciously like a Babushka doll.
But hey, this is _my_ blog post, and if I want to make it sound cool, I will.

At least for me, this "Nebula" approach is something Iâ€™d like to try out in 2025.
Letâ€™s see what happens.
