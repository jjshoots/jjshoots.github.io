### After 2 years...

I'm back again!
Lots of things have happened since the last posting, lots of things that I'll probably write about one dayâ„¢.
But the topic of today is about an extraordinary opportunity I've had to join an expedition cruise with National Geographic and Lindblad Expeditions across the remote pacific ocean for 23 days.

### The person responsible

Gratitude where gratitude is due, this voyage wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for the gracious invite of [Adi Gajigan](https://andriangajigan.com/) (last name pronounced 'gah-hee-gun').
Adi is a National Geographic explorer and oceanographer who studies (and is practically obsessed with) plankton and its importance to the planet.
I have worked with Adi over the past year on using computer vision to classify and quantify plankton populations across various parts of the ocean, and when Lindblad Expeditions and the National Geographic Society reached out to him on an opportunity to sample across the remote pacific ocean aboard an expedition cruise ship, he generously decided to invite me along.

Alongside the two of us was also a high school teacher from New Hampshire, United States.
Her name was Kelly Blais (pronounced Kelly Blah) and she was part of the [National Geographic Society Grosvenor Teacher Fellowship](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/society/education-resources/professional-development/grosvenor-teacher-fellows/), a scheme where examplary educators are invited aboard various voyages.
The key intention here is for teachers to bring their onboard experiences into the classroom, allowing students and colleagues experience a higher level of geographic awareness.

### What is a National Geographic Lindblad Expedition?

[Lindblad Expeditions](https://world.expeditions.com/about/) is an ecotourism company, where they bring paying guests aboard one of their many capable ships to the most remote locations on the planet.
Their primary destinations include places like the Arctic, Antartica, the Galapagos islands, and more.
Guests get the opportunity to explore these places not only through the vessel itself, but also on smaller Zodiac boats that bring guests to perform land excursions or to observe wildlife up close.
For the past 20 years, Lindblad has partnered with National Geographic to enhance experiences by allowing guests to explore alongside National Geographic explorers and photographers.
There is a lot to this partnership and what the company does, and if you'd like to know more, Google is your friend.

### The National Geographic Resolution

The ship that I was on is the National Geographic Resolution - an exceedingly capable ship meant to traverse the Arctic and Antarcica regions.

<p style="text-align: center;">The National Geographic Resolution</p>

Since I'm an engineer, here are some facts to geek out on:
- At the time of writing, this is one of three PC5 class icebreaking cruise ships on the planet.
One other ship - The National Geographic Endurance, is also a Lindblad Expeditions ship.
- The ship uses a diesel electric drivetrain with dynamic stability.
It consists of two V12 and two I8 engines, all turbodiesel, with a combined output of 10,000 horsepower.
The engines were paired directly to generators, where electrical power is then used to power all the ship's systems.
- Propulsion is handled through two rear-mounted azipods with 3-meter diameter stainless steel propellers, capable of going from as low as 15 RPM to (IIRC) 170 RPM.
Two bow thrusters with a combined output of 2,000 horsepower allows the ship - together with the azipods - to be pushed from side-to-side without changing yaw.
- Due to the unique layout of the propulsion units, there is no need for anchors in most conditions as the ship is able to hold itself at a fixed location dynamically in winds of up-to 40 knots.
- There are three radar systems on the ship, of varying ranges and resolution.
The one with the highest resolution is able to see birds sitting on water.
- The ship is made of 1 inch steel throughout, with the bow steel probably being thicker.
This allows it to punch through ice as thick as 1 meter with minimal issues.

Throughout the journey, the ship burned about USD 1.2 million in marine diesel.
That's a whopping 35 tonnes of fuel a day, which works out to about 332 litres of diesel per person on board the vessel per day (there were about 120 people on the ship, staff included).
That's a very sobering number, and while I don't have anything greenwashing to say, I thought it's important to put it out there.

### The Journey

You're probably bored of all the not-actually-the-expedition stuff by now, so let's begin first with the path we took.

The image is not the clearest thing in the world, so for those who are more inclined to see the path we took, [here]({{ site.bas_path }}/resources/posts/nglex/PacificTrip.kml) is the file with the tracking data that you can upload into Google Earch to view with better resolution.
The journey itself took us to the following islands in order:

1. Koror, Palau
2. Guam
3. Magur, Chuuk
4. Pohnpei (not that Pompeii), Chuuk
5. Butaritari, Kiribati (pronounced Kee-ree-bas)
6. Tarawa, Kiribati
7. Niue (it's its own freaking country with a population of 1,600. Crazy!)
8. Aitutaki, Cook Islands
9. Bora Bora, French Polynesia
10. Tahiti, French Polynesia

I probably won't do a detailed write up of each location (I'm not hardworking enough for that).
Instead, here are the highlights.

### Wildlife

#### Jellyfish Lake, Palau

Our first intended encounter with exotic wildlife happened in Palau, where we swam in [Jellyfish Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jellyfish_Lake).
Jellyfish Lake is home to the Golden Jellyfish and the Moon Jellyfish.
The Golden Jellyfish is endemic (science speak for unique) to this lake.
Both jellyfish have evolved over several thousand years to have no stingers, which means they are safe to swim with.
So naturally, we got to swim with them:
