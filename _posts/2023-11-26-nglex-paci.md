### After 2 years...

I'm back again!
Lots of things have happened since the last posting, lots of things that I'll probably write about one day™.
But the topic of today is about an extraordinary opportunity I've had about joining an expedition with National Geographic and Lindblad Expeditions across the remote pacific ocean for 23 days.

### The person responsible

Gratitude where gratitude is due, I wouldn't have gotten this opportunity if it weren't for the gracious invite of [Adi Gajigan](https://andriangajigan.com/) (last name pronounced 'gah-hee-gun').
Adi is a National Geographic explorer and oceanographer at the University of Hawaii who studies (and is practically obsessed with) plankton and its importance to the planet.
I have worked with Adi over the past year on using computer vision to classify and quantify plankton populations across various parts of the ocean, and when Lindblad Expeditions and the National Geographic Society reached out to him on an opportunity to sample across the remote pacific ocean aboard an expedition cruise ship, he generously decided to invite me along.

<p style="text-align: center;">Left: Adi, Right: me; The second day, where we scoured the island of Palau in search of confiscated scientific equipment.</p>

Alongside the two of us was also a high school teacher from New Hampshire, United States.
Her name was Kelly Blais (pronounced Kelly Blah) and she was part of the [National Geographic Society Grosvenor Teacher Fellowship](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/society/education-resources/professional-development/grosvenor-teacher-fellows/), a scheme where examplary educators are invited aboard various voyages.
The key intention here is for teachers to bring their onboard experiences into the classroom, allowing students and colleagues access to a higher level of geographic awareness.

### What is a National Geographic Lindblad Expedition?

[Lindblad Expeditions](https://world.expeditions.com/about/) is an ecotourism company, where they bring paying guests aboard one of their many capable ships to the most remote locations on the planet.
Their primary destinations include places like the Arctic, Antartica, the Galapagos islands, and more.
Guests get the opportunity to explore these places not only through the vessel itself, but also on smaller Zodiac boats that bring guests to perform land excursions or to observe wildlife up close.
For the past 20 years, Lindblad has partnered with National Geographic to enhance experiences by allowing guests to explore alongside National Geographic explorers and photographers.
There is a lot to this partnership and what the company does, and if you'd like to know more, Google is your friend.

### The Journey

This is the path we took over 23 days:

The image is not the clearest thing in the world, so for those who are more inclined to see the path we took, [here]({{ site.bas_path }}/resources/posts/nglex/PacificTrip.kml) is the file with the tracking data that you can upload into Google Earch to view with better resolution.
The journey itself took us to the following islands in order:

1. Koror, Palau
2. Guam
3. Magur, Chuuk
4. Pohnpei (not that Pompeii), Chuuk
5. Butaritari, Kiribati (pronounced Kee-ree-bas)
6. Tarawa, Kiribati
7. Niue (it's its own freaking country with a population of 1,600. Crazy!)
8. Aitutaki, Cook Islands
9. Bora Bora, French Polynesia
10. Tahiti, French Polynesia

I probably won't do a detailed write up of each location (I'm not hardworking enough for that).

### The National Geographic Resolution

The ship that I was on is the National Geographic Resolution - an exceedingly capable ship meant to traverse the Arctic and Antarcica regions.

<img src="{{ site.base_path }}/resources/posts/nglex/natgeo_resolution.jpg" width="80%" style="display:block;margin:0 auto;">
<p style="text-align: center;">The National Geographic Resolution</p>

Since I'm an engineer, here are some facts to geek out on:
- At the time of writing, this is one of three PC5 class icebreaking cruise ships on the planet.
One other ship - The National Geographic Endurance, is also a Lindblad Expeditions ship.
- The ship uses a diesel electric drivetrain with dynamic stability.
It consists of two V12 and two I8 engines, all turbodiesel, with a combined output of 10,000 horsepower.
The engines were paired directly to generators, where electrical power is then used to power all the ship's systems.
- Propulsion is handled through two rear-mounted azipods with 3-meter diameter stainless steel propellers, capable of going from as low as 15 RPM to (IIRC) 170 RPM.
Two bow thrusters with a combined output of 2,000 horsepower allows the ship - together with the azipods - to be pushed from side-to-side without changing yaw.
- Due to the unique layout of the propulsion units, there is no need for anchors in most conditions as the ship is able to hold itself at a fixed location dynamically in winds of up-to 40 knots.
- There are three radar systems on the ship, of varying ranges and resolution.
The one with the highest resolution is able to see birds sitting on water.
- The ship is made of 1 inch steel throughout, with the bow steel probably being thicker.
This allows it to punch through ice as thick as 1 meter with minimal issues.

Throughout the journey, the ship burned about USD 1.2 million in marine diesel.
That's a whopping 35 tonnes of fuel a day, which works out to about 332 litres of diesel per person on board the vessel per day (there were about 120 people on the ship, staff included).
That's a very sobering number, and while I don't have anything greenwashing to say, I thought it's important to put it out there.

While we were on the ship, we were posted in the Science Hub.
A very cool venue where we had surround screens and enough desk space to host all our equipment.
Intrigued guests could come in at any time and ask questions and engage in the science that we were doing onboard.

##### Open Bridge Policy

The ship operates an "open bridge policy", a policy where anyone at any time is allowed on the bridge to observe crew activity.
This meant I was on the bridge a whole lot - you can't blame me, lots of things to geek out about there.

### Wildlife
##### Jellyfish Lake, Palau

Our first intended encounter with exotic wildlife happened in Palau, where we swam in [Jellyfish Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jellyfish_Lake).
Jellyfish Lake is home to the Golden Jellyfish and the Moon Jellyfish.
The Golden Jellyfish is endemic (science speak for unique) to this lake.
Both jellyfish have evolved over several thousand years to have no stingers, which means they are safe to swim with.
So naturally, we got to swim with and touch them (they just felt like agar-agar underwater):

There was also a Cardinalfish, I found this interesting because I could only see these in aquariums back home in Malaysia.

<p style="text-align: center;">Cardinalfish.</p>

##### Manta Ray, Palau

We also saw a Manta Ray.
I'm not sure if there were more than one that day, but this is the one we got a close up of:

<img src="{{ site.base_path }}/resources/posts/nglex/manta_ray.jpg" width="80%" style="display:block;margin:0 auto;">
<p style="text-align: center;">Probably the most graceful creature I've ever been up close to. Along with an indication of how absolutely clear the water was.</p>
<br>

<p style="text-align: center;">A video of the Manta Ray, in case the previous picture just looks like a rock to you, **ahem sis**.</p>

##### Humpback Whales

On our way out of Aitutaki, we witnessed a small pod of humpback whales.
According to the naturalists, it was a mom and calf pair with an escort male, with the calf supposedly born not too long ago.
I could barely tell there were 3 humpback whales in the water.
For me, this was a bucket list item ticked off before it even entered the list.

<iframe style="display: block; margin: auto;" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oitUool8Ua8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p style="text-align: center;">A trio of humpback whales we saw.</p>

##### Notable Mentions

These are wildlife creatures that I didn't have the chance to get on a digital media format, but nevertheless will record here for my memory:

1. **Flying fish**, arguably saw very late into the journey but very memorable
2. **Black tip reef sharks** on one of the many snorkeling sessions we did
3. **Cuttlefish**, apparently super rare to see during snorkeling
4. **Stingrays**, yes I swam with them
5. **Sea cucumber**, like a big shit
6. **Pilot Whales**, a group of 150 - about 3 pods

Throughout the journey, we had about 10 sessions where we could snorkel, and all of them were execellent - no pollution, crystal clear water, teeming with wildlife.
Here are some of the videos I have, these were taken with my phone at the time (Samsung Galaxy S10) through a plastic pouch.
They look much better in person.

### Moments
##### Swimming over Mariana's Trench

We had an opportunity to perform a small detour over Challenger's Deep, Mariana's Trench when transiting from Palau to Guam.
Since the conditions were favourable and because our ship could hold position without dropping anchor, blue water swimming over the Trench was possible.
This was also another bucket list item ticked off before it entered the list.
Unfortunately I don't have any pictures of me over the Trench.

##### Visiting Magur, Chuuk and interacting with locals

##### Experiencing the calming dulldrums at the planet's thermal equator

The Intertropical Convergence Zone, AKA dulldrums, are a zone over the thermal equator known for its monotonous windless weather.
Expedition staff Joe Holliday can probably tell you everything about it.
This was mesmerizing to me because I have never seen the ocean _that_ calm before, it was practically a sheet of glass.
Since we were travelling South into the thermal equator at the time, the ocean just got calmer and calmer as the day passed.
Needless to say, I probably spent the most time on deck this day, it was ✨magical✨.

<p style="text-align: center;">Water's so calm you can see the ship's reflection. This is the OCEAN we're talking about.</p>

##### Giving a talk on Artificial Intelligence to guests and expedition staff

I gave a talk aboard the ship about AI, where it came from, where we are, and where we're going.

##### Visiting the Marae Taputapuatea in Raiatea

### People

All of the people aboard the ship have been incredibly inspiring.
From Captain Martin Graser with his can-do attitude when dealing with a USD 150M ship to the hotel staff striving to deliver the best experience 110% of the time.
Here are some of the people I want to give special attention to.

##### Captain Martin Graser

##### Tua Pittman

##### Jennifer Kingsley

##### Joseph Holliday

##### Nitye Sood

##### Marco Pizzolato & Alexandra Kristjánsdóttir

Yes, I copied Alexandra's last name from her Instagram profile.
