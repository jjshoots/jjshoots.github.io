### This year...

I've let this website run on its own for several years now, yet it seems I only post once a year on average.
This is that once-a-year post.
Rather than focusing on a single event, this post reflects the tapestry of moments that made up my 2024.
The year feels like a blur --- here, gone, a blink.

The major highlights were:

1. Finished my PhD(?!).
2. Worked at a startup in LA, ending with a stay at a billionaire's house.
3. Wrapped up an internship at Sony AI in Tokyo.

I won't unpack much of these points here, if you're curious, reach out and I'd be glad to share.
Instead, this post is about the quiet seconds of growth, the moments between the moments --- the shower thoughts, sunsets, and stillness.

The narrative is going to be messy.
It's my blog post, deal with it.
To make matters worse, I'll scatter highlight images of this year throughout.
I prefer it this way, a multi-narrative approach, mirroring how my mind works.

### The road to deeper connection - good conversations

This year, I learned that good conversations are a skill.
Like any other skill, it requires practice.
Deep connections begin here.

Many of us strive to project confidence and groundedness.
We aim to build trust, appear approachable, and generally cultivate a calm, centered presence.
To me, the end goal is clear, but path to achieving that is so unclear.

2024 had me interacting with some incredible people --- ones with massive influence, others with exceptional talent, and many still finding their way, like me.
Kindness was universal, but only a few left a lasting impression, the most meaningful conversations were with people who knew themselves, articulated ideas cleanly, can separate facts from opinions.

It‚Äôs one thing to recognize these qualities, but without actionable ways to apply them, they‚Äôre just abstract ideals.

##### The Blank Slate

I once believed kind words and active listening were the keys to meaningful conversations.
This _Blank Slate_ approach involved entering conversations without preconceptions, asking questions, and deeply listening.

<p style="text-align: center;">Presenting a talk at a <a href="https://lu.ma/sa4r9lg9">Tokyo AI</a> event.</p>

It works well --- _if_ the other person has something to unload.
But when both people take this approach, conversations can become hollow, like two people waiting for the other to set the tone.

I‚Äôm not sure if this Blank Slate Approach is quite the same as active listening, but I‚Äôve found that it doesn‚Äôt always lead to the deeper connections I expect.

##### The Buffet Dinner

Some say interesting people attract interesting people.

I‚Äôve learned that being "interesting" can sometimes alienate.
Unusual experiences or strong opinions intrigue others at first but can quickly create distance --- what I call the _Buffet Dinner_ effect.
Great conversations are built on shared understanding, yet unique perspectives often lack common ground.

##### So... now what?

Surprising to no one, attracting good conversation lies the intersection of _being interesting_ and _being interested_.
This is the tension between the _Buffet Dinner_ and the _Blank Slate_.
Just as unsurprisingly, this balance requires adapting to each person --- reading their openness, interests, and conversational cues in real-time.

I remind myself often that conversations are like bartering : an exchange of stories, ideas, and pieces of ourselves.
The goal isn‚Äôt to "win" but to create a mutually rewarding exchange.
This happens with we share our thoughts at the right moments and remain open to theirs.
People _do_ want to know what we think --- but only when our timing aligns with the rhythm of the conversation.

How do we sense the right moment?
I'm still working on it, but I think the answer is:

_Presence_.

Being fully present means shelving assumptions, silencing inner monologues, and leaning into the moment with genuine curiosity.
It's not about perfection or pretense --- it's about showing up, fully engaged and open to connection.
_Wherever you are, be all there._

#### The Destination or the Journey?

**The Company**.
There it is, my 2024 answer to the question front and center.

Most of my life, I've felt like I was running.
Running _towards_ something; or maybe _from_ something.

I‚Äôve pushed myself relentlessly, honing my technical craft, striving to get somewhere.
But this year, I‚Äôve started to understand a hard truth: there‚Äôs no finish line that guarantees happiness; no summit where contentment waits.

This realization isn‚Äôt new --- it‚Äôs the kind of thing you hear in passing and nod along to.
But there‚Äôs a difference between knowing something and truly _feeling_ its weight.
That weight didn‚Äôt settle on me until late this year.

Maybe it's because I'm now swimming with the sharks --- extremely talented researchers known for ground-breaking work, constantly feeling like I'll never reach their level.
Or maybe it's because I've drifted from the friends who defined my early adulthood.
(You know who you are).

This year's harsh reality check is that _everyone in life ends up at the same destination_.
I spent so much time chasing a non-existent ‚Äúrainbow at the end of the tunnel,‚Äù trying to make my journey colorful.
I should instead have been focusing on the people who have been with me along the way --- those fleeting connections that make the present more meaningful.

It wasn‚Äôt always me reaching out.
Most of the time, these people came into my life, and I didn‚Äôt turn them away.
I was lucky to have them around when I needed it most.
But now, having lived in a place [infamous for social isolation](https://www.nippon.com/en/in-depth/d00763/), I feel the weight of my own social limitations.

Maybe life isn't just about reaching the top.
Maybe it's about who we become, who we allow ourselves to be, and who we share these fleeting moments with.

#### Wrapping Up

I‚Äôm grateful for where I am and for the chance to realize I‚Äôd lost my way for a time. As 2024 winds down, I‚Äôm optimistic about what‚Äôs ahead.
Oh, it's also December 16.
