### This year...

I've let this website live on its own for several years now, and it feels right that I update it just once a year—an annual tradition, if you will.
Today's post isn't focused on a single event, but rather a tapestry of moments that made up my 2024. It's strange, but the year seems to have slipped through my fingers, a blur of experiences that came and went in a whirlwind.
But in that blur, there were some undeniable highlights:

I completed my PhD (yay?!)
I had the unexpected opportunity to work for a billionaire at his tech startup—and even spent a week in his home.
I landed an internship at Sony AI in Tokyo.
