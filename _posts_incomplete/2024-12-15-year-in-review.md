### This year...

I've let this website run on its own for several years now, and it's clear I post maybe once a year, if that.
Well, this is that once-a-year post.
Rather than focusing on a single event, this post reflects the tapestry of moments that made up my 2024.
It's strange how quickly the year seems to have slipped away, a blur of experiences that came and went in the blink of an eye.

The major highlights were:

1. I completed my PhD (yay?!)
2. I worked at a startup in LA, which led to a visit to a billionaire's house.
3. I wrapped up an internship at Sony AI in Tokyo.

I wonâ€™t dive deep into these pointsâ€”feel free to reach out if you're curious about them, and I'll be happy to share.
This post is more about the moments of growth throughout the year.
The insights that emerged in the moments between the moments - the quiet in the shower or the orange of a sunset.

That said, I'll scatter images that have highlighted this year throughout this post, so it's kind of a post with two very messy storylines - a pretty accurate representation of what goes on in my head.

### On building deeper connections

One of the biggest lessons Iâ€™ve learned this year is the importance of building meaningful connections from the start.
Many of us, myself included, often strive to project confidence and groundedness.
We want to build trust, make ourselves approachable, and generally cultivate a calm, centered presence.

But while the end goal is clear, Iâ€™ve often found the path to get there unclear.

Over the course of 2024, I had the privilege of interacting with a range of incredible people - some with massive influence (a billion dollars of influence), others with exceptional talent, and many who, like me, are still figuring things out.
Even though everyone I met was kind, some left a deeper impression than others.
Being the introspective kind, I tend to overanalyze these conversations, trying to find common threads that I can learn from.

The most meaningful conversations I had were with those who were intellectually curious - people who knew themselves, articulated their ideas clearly, and distinguished between facts and opinions.
Itâ€™s one thing to recognize these qualities, but without actionable ways to apply them, theyâ€™re just abstract ideals.

##### The Blank Slate

Reflecting on the connections Iâ€™ve built, I realized how long I relied on a simple assumption: kind words are the key to meaningful conversations.
This usually translated to asking questions, listening intently, and letting the other person do the talking.

<p style="text-align: center;">Presenting a talk at a <a href="https://lu.ma/sa4r9lg9">Tokyo AI</a> event.</p>

I call this the _Blank Slate_ - an approach where I enter a conversation with no preconceptions, listening intently and asking questions to understand the other personâ€™s perspective.
While this approach often works well, Iâ€™ve realized that itâ€™s most effective when the other person has something they need to unload.
Without that, and unless the person is thoughtful enough to return the favor, these conversations can feel one-sided, leaving me with little in return.
The worst case scenario happens when two similar people approach the conversation this way, leading to nothing but shallow remarks.
I imagine this is the equivalent of having two people walk into a room expecting the other person to build the atmosphere for them.

Iâ€™m not sure if this Blank Slate Approach is quite the same as active listening, but Iâ€™ve found that it doesnâ€™t always lead to the deeper connections I expected.

##### The Plate of Daggers

Some people say that to attract interesting people, you have to be interesting yourself.
But hereâ€™s the question: how does "being interesting" actually foster deep connections?
And _why does it sometimes seem harder to connect with people the more unique your experiences become?_

At its core, deep connection is built on shared understanding through shared experiences.
Ironically, the more unusual your experiences, the less likely others can relate.
Being interesting, then, often feels like presenting a _Plate of Daggers_ - strong opinions or unique perspectives that will initially intrigue others but quickly alienate them.

##### So... now what?

I think it surprises absolutely no one that the key to building deeper connections lies in balancing being interesting and being interested.
This is the tension between the _Plate of Daggers_ and the _Blank Slate_.
And, just as unsurprisingly, the ideal ratio depends entirely on the person youâ€™re engaging with - their emotional baggage, the mood theyâ€™re in that day, and perhaps even the alignment of the cosmos.

The more I think about it, the more I see conversations as a sort of bartering system.
You trade stories, ideas, and pieces of yourself, hoping the other person offers something of equal value in return.
The goal isnâ€™t to "win" or outshine, but to create a mutually rewarding exchange.

That said, the key difference between bartering tangible goods and sharing ideas in a conversation is uncertainty.
When you barter a physical entity, you know exactly what youâ€™re giving and what youâ€™re getting in return.
Conversations, on the other hand, are more ambiguous.

I believe that the foundation of meaningful conversations - and by extension, deeper connections - lies in being fully present.
That means observing the conversation and whether more information needs to be put on the table, or whether more space needs to be cleared.
_Wherever you are, be all there_.

Being present requires effort.
It asks you to shelve your assumptions, silence your inner monologue, and lean into the moment with curiosity and openness.
Yet, I feel like this has been the surest way to bridge the gap between two people and uncover the intangible: trust, understanding, and the beginnings of something deeper.

#### The Destination or the Journey?

So, why the sudden need to reconnect more?
I'm 27, basically a fully grown man who should have learned social skills some 20 years ago.
The answer is that
