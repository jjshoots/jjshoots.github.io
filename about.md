### But for those on the formal side: (First Name) Jun Jet (Last Name) Tai.

I hail from the small, lesser known country of Malaysia, where I grew up in its capital - Kuala Lumpur.
My current location is Coventry, United Kingdom.

I'm a software engineer by trade, with a PhD in artificial intelligence and unmanned aerial vehicles.
My specialization includes reinforcement learning, computer vision, optimal control and robotics.
I also have experience in large language models, Linux-based operating systems, and wireless hacking.
My favourite text editor is (Neo)Vim, if that tells you anything.

My interests lie in systems that augment human capabilities, such as aircraft fly-by-wire systems, reinforcement learning for next-best-move prediction, and modifying Vim to create the world's best code editor for myself.
There is something truly uncanny about having a machine feel like an extension of self that drives my interest in everything I do.

In my free time, I fly FPV drones and play various musical instruments - machines augmenting my ability to perceive and influence the world.
I also enjoy cars, although I try to reduce my usage of them now as they are terrible machines for the environment.
