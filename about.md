### (First Name) Jun Jet (Last Name) Tai.

I am a software engineer with a PhD in applied AI for UAVs from [Coventry University](https://www.coventry.ac.uk/).
Originally from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, I’m now based in Tokyo, Japan, where I work with Sony AI.

I’ve had the privilege of contributing to exciting projects like [GT Sophy](https://www.gran-turismo.com/us/gran-turismo-sophy/)
and leading the development on reinforcement learning libraries such as
[Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/), [Atari Learning Environment](https://ale.farama.org/), [PettingZoo](https://pettingzoo.farama.org/) and [Shimmy](https://shimmy.farama.org/) at the Farama Foundation.
My work focuses on building systems that enhance human capabilities, whether it’s through decision-making AI, intuitive interfaces, or tools that feel like seamless extensions of ourselves.

Outside of work, I enjoy flying FPV drones, playing musical instruments, and dabbling in Dota 2 (I am a Herald, sadly).
I also keep tropical aquarium fish and stay active through bouldering, badminton, and yoga.

This site is where I share lesser-known projects and ideas I’m exploring.
