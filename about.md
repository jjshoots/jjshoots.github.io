### (First Name) Jun Jet (Last Name) Tai.

That's for those on the formal side.

I hail from the small, lesser known country of Malaysia, where I grew up in its capital - Kuala Lumpur.
My current location is Tokyo, Japan, where I am currently interning for Sony AI.
I'm classify myself as a software engineer, with a PhD specialization in AI and UAVs.

My life motto is: **Build Cool Shit, Reduce World Suck**, if that tells you anything.
My interests lie in systems that augment human capabilities, such as aircraft fly-by-wire systems, reinforcement learning for next-best-move prediction, and modifying (Neo)Vim to create the world's best code editor for myself.
There is something truly uncanny about having a machine feel like an extension of self that drives my interest in everything I do.

In my free time, I fly FPV drones and play various musical instruments - machines augmenting my ability to perceive and influence the world.
I also enjoy cars, although I try to reduce my usage of them now as they are terrible machines for the environment.

This is not a place I brag about myself - GitHub, LinkedIn, and Google Scholar are there should you so be inclined.
Instead, I intend to record lesser known things and projects that I'm doing here.
However, if you insist: [**here's my CV**](https://jjshoots.ddns.net:8190/api/public/dl/kCFhE3Q9?inline=true).
